# Module 11: Explore an Azure AI Search index (UI)

## Lab overview

Let's imagine you work for Fourth Coffee, a national coffee chain. You're asked to help build a knowledge-mining solution that makes it easy to search for insights about customer experiences. You decide to build an Azure AI Search index using data extracted from customer reviews.  

In this lab, you will:

- Create Azure resources
- Extract data from a data source
- Enrich data with AI skills
- Use Azure's indexer in the Azure portal
- Query your search index
- Review results saved to a Knowledge Store

## Estimated timing: 2 hours

## Pre-requisites Required

The solution you'll create for Fourth Coffee requires the following resources in your Azure subscription:

- An **Azure AI Search** resource, which will manage indexing and querying.

- An **Azure AI services** resource, which provides AI services for skills that your search solution can use to enrich the data in the data source with AI-generated insights.

    > **Note**
    > Your Azure AI Search and Azure AI services resources must be in the same location!

- A **Storage account** with blob containers, which will store raw documents and other collections of tables, objects, or files.

## Exercise 3: Query the index

Use the Search Explorer to write and test queries. Search Explorer is a tool built into the Azure portal that gives you an easy way to validate the quality of your search index. You can use Search Explorer to write queries and review results in JSON.

1. In your Search service's *Overview* page, select **Search explorer** at the top of the screen.

   ![Screenshot of how to find Search explorer.](media/lab11-36.png)

1. Notice how the index selected is the *coffee-index* you created.  Below the index selected, change the *view* to **JSON view**. 

     ![](media/search-explorer-query.png)

1. In the **JSON query editor** field, copy and paste:
   
    ```json
    {
        "search": "*",
        "count": true
    }
    ```
1. Select **Search**. The search query returns all the documents in the search index, including a count of all the documents in the **@odata.count** field. The search index should return a JSON document containing your search results.

1. Now let's filter by location. In the **JSON query editor** field, copy and paste:
     
    ```json
    {
        "search": "locations:'Chicago'",
        "count": true
    }
    ```
1. Select **Search**. The query searches all the documents in the  index and filters for reviews with a Chicago location. You should see `3` in the `@odata.count` field.

1. Now let's filter by sentiment. In the **JSON query editor** field, copy and paste:
   
    ```json
    {
        "search": "sentiment:'negative'",
        "count": true
    }
    ```
1. Select **Search**. The query searches all the documents in the index and filters for reviews with a negative sentiment. You should see `1` in the `@odata.count` field.

   > **Note**
   > See how the results are sorted by `@search.score`. This is the score assigned by the search engine to show how closely the results match the given query.

1. One of the problems we might want to solve is why there might be certain reviews. Let's take a look at the key phrases associated with the negative review. What do you think might be the cause of the review?

## Exercise 4: Review the knowledge store

Let's see the power of the knowledge store in action. When you ran the *Import data wizard*, you also created a knowledge store. Inside the knowledge store, you'll find the enriched data extracted by AI skills persists in the form of projections and tables.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate back to your Azure storage account.

1. In the left-hand menu pane, select **Containers (1)**. Select the **knowledge-store (2)** container.

    ![Screenshot of the knowledge-store container.](media/containe(1).png)

1. Select any of the items.

    ![](media/lab11-42.png)

1. Click the **objectprojection.json** file.

    ![Screenshot of the objectprojection.json.](media/lab11-44.png)

1. Select **Edit** to see the JSON produced for one of the documents from your Azure data store.

    ![Screenshot of how to find the edit button.](media/lab11-45.png)

1. Select the storage blob breadcrumb at the top left of the screen to return to the Storage account *Containers*.

    ![Screenshot of the storage blob breadcrumb.](media/knowledgestore.png)

1. In the **Containers (1)**, select the container **coffee-skillset-image-projection (2)**.

    ![Screenshot of the skillset container.](media/containe(2).png)

1.  Select any of the items.

     ![Screenshot of the skillset container.](media/lab11-48.png)

1. Select any of the *.jpg* files. Select **Edit** to see the image stored in the document. Notice how all the images from the documents are stored in this manner.

    ![Screenshot of the saved image.](media/lab11-43.png)

1. Select the storage blob breadcrumb at the top left of the screen to return to the Storage account *Containers*.

1. Select **Storage browser** on the left-hand panel, and select **Tables**. There's a table for each entity in the index. Select the table *coffeeSkillsetKeyPhrases*.

     ![Screenshot of the saved image.](media/lab11-49.png)

    Look at the key phrases the knowledge store was able to capture from the content in the reviews. Many of the fields are keys, so you can link the tables like a relational database. The last field shows the key phrases that were extracted by the skillset.
