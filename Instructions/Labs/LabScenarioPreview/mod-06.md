# Lab Scenario Preview: Module 06: Analyze text with Language Studio

## Lab overview

In this exercise you will explore the capabilities of Azure AI Language by analyzing some example hotel reviews. You'll use Language Studio to understand whether the reviews are mostly positive or negative.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that deals with written and spoken language. You can use NLP to build solutions that extract semantic meaning from text or speech, or that formulate meaningful responses in natural language.

For example, suppose the fictitious travel agent Margie's Travel encourages customers to submit reviews for hotel stays. You could use the Language service to identify key phrases, determine which reviews are positive and which are negative, or analyze the review text for mentions of known entities such as locations or people.

Azure AI Language Service includes text analysis and NLP capabilities. These include the identification of key phrases in text, and the classification of text based on sentiment.
