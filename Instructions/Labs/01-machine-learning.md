# Module 01: Explore Automated Machine Learning in Azure Machine Learning

## Lab overview

In this exercise, you'll use the automated machine learning feature in **Azure Machine Learning** to train and evaluate a machine learning model. You'll then deploy and test the trained model.

>**Important**
>At this time, it is possible to author and deploy a model as a web service in the Azure Machine Learning Studio, but not to test it in the Studio. Therefore, all but the last section of steps before clean-up are possible to complete. We will update as this changes.

## Lab objectives

In this lab, you will perform:

- Creating an *Azure Machine Learning workspace* resource
- Use automated machine learning to train a model

## Estimated timing: 60 minutes

### Task 2: Use automated machine learning to train a model

Automated machine learning enables you to try multiple algorithms and parameters to train multiple models, and identify the best one for your data. In this exercise, you'll use a dataset of historical bicycle rental details to train a model that predicts the number of bicycle rentals that should be expected on a given day, based on seasonal and meteorological features.

  ## Review the best model

When the automated machine learning job has completed, you can review the best model it trained.

1. On the **Overview** tab of the automated machine learning job, note the best model summary.

    ![](media/lab1-2.png)

    > **Note**
    > You may see a message under the status "Warning: User specified exit score reached...". This is an expected message. Please continue to the next step.
  
1. Select the text under **Algorithm name** for the best model to view its details.

1. Select the **Metrics** tab and select the **residuals** and **predicted_true** charts if they are not already selected. 

    Review the charts which show the performance of the model. The **residuals** chart shows the *residuals* (the differences between predicted and actual values) as a histogram. The **predicted_true** chart compares the predicted values against the true values.

### Task 3: Deploy the model

1. On the **Model** tab for the best model trained by your automated machine learning job, select **Deploy** and use the **Web service** option to deploy the model with the following settings:
    - **Name**: predict-rentals  **(1)**
    - **Description**: Predict cycle rentals **(2)**
    - **Compute type**: Azure Container Instance **(3)**
    - **Enable authentication**: *Selected* **(4)**
    - Select **Deploy**

     ![](media/lab1-4.png)

1. Wait for the deployment to start - this may take a few seconds. The **Deploy status** for the **predict-rentals** endpoint will be indicated in the main part of the page as *Running*.
1. Wait for the **Deploy status** to change to *Succeeded*. This may take 5-10 minutes.
   
> **Congratulations** on completing the task! Now, it's time to validate it. Here are the steps:
